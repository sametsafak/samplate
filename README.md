# samplate
Basic but powerful frontend boilerplate.


## Tell me more bro
This boilerplate can be configured with gulp.config.js file.

You can see the process of tasks whether completed or not while working via native os notifications! // OSX is better of course :)

It has an http server and file includer! You don't have to use php or something else to include an html i.e. header.html

### What can you do with this boilerplate:

*Compile and auto prefix sass files (you have some helper classes like margins, paddings etc.)

*Create javascript bundles transpiled via babel.

*Lint javascript files if you set lint option to true inside of gulp.config.js file

*Direct copy or optimize and copy images.

*Copy folders or files.

*Include htmls inside of htmls (You don't have to use php or something else).

*Export files for production.

*Create a zip file of project (without dist and node_modules folder)

*Set specific setting for export to production or watch mode to improve working performance white in watch mode.
