# samplate
Basic but powerful frontend boilerplate.


## Tell me more!
This boilerplate can be configured with gulp.config.js file.

You can see the process of tasks whether completed or not while working via native os notifications! // OSX is better of course :)

It has an http server and file includer! You don't have to use php or something else to include an html i.e. header.html

### What can you do with this boilerplate?

* Compile and auto prefix sass files (**it has some helper classes like margins, paddings etc.**)
* Create javascript bundles transpiled via babel.
* Lint javascript files if you set lint option to true inside of gulp.config.js file.
* Direct copy or optimize and copy images.
* Copy folders or files.
* Include html files inside of html files (**You don't have to use php or something else**).
* Export files for production.
* Create a zip file of project (**without dist and node_modules folder**)
* Set specific setting for export to production or watch mode to improve working performance white in watch mode.
